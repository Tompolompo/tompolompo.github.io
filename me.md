I grew up in Stockholm and had what I believe was a rather typical Swedish upbringing. When I was about to start high school I began something that was to become a big part of my life up until this day. I began a journey to become a professional athlete, specifically as a javelin thrower. At this time my life was built around training. I was either at the training grounds, home studying the technique of the worlds best throwers on Youtube or reading up on how best to optimize my performance through different training regimes and diets. I even spent one year during high school in Australia at a sports school to gain new insights.

Parallel with this, a curiosity about the natural world had sparked in me. I was studying the natural science program in high school and mathematics and physics was something that truly inspired me.

After high school my trainer moved to Gothenburg and since he was one of the best javelin coaches in Sweden I decided to move after him and to really give a career as a professional athlete a shot. I also started my studies within engineering physics to satisfy my curiosity of the inner workings of the natural world. However, my life still revolved around training and this was my number one priority. I still managed to excel in my studies, despite training 5-9 times a week, going on several international training camps a year and maintaining a strict eating and sleeping schedule. I am convinced that this combination has forced me to become tremendously time efficient and to focus on what is really important.

Unfortunately, the life as a javelin thrower is difficult and countless of injuries and other drawbacks stopped my plan of becoming a professional javelin thrower. Although my plans of becoming a professional javeling thrower did not pan out I believe it has shaped me in a very positive way. It has taught me to focus on details, to not give up during periods of setbacks and to always strive to become as good as I can be, in all areas of life.

Luckily, I also had my studies of physics that really inspired me and this gradually became a bigger part of my life. Through the study of Newtonian mechanics to Einsteinâ€™s general relativity to quantum field theory and beyond, my initial curiosity of the natural world has fuelled my ability to solve difficult problems. It has also made me almost addicted to learn new things and I am constantly exploring new subjects of all kinds. This is something I am very grateful for and I want to continue foster this part of me through out my life.

In 2019/2020, I went on an exchange year to Utrecht in the Netherlands and during this year several changes in my life took place. First, due to the many setbacks as a javelin thrower, I changed my sport focus towards olympic weightlifting instead. Second, even though I had chose *physics* as my master, I started to become increasingly intrested in the developments of AI and in particular the long-term impact that AI might have on our society. Eventually, this interest lead me to write my master thesis on artificial general intelligence the spring of 2021. During my thesis, I became convinced that it was AI that I wanted to work with and thus decided to take an additional year at Chalmers to delve deeper into the subject. In hindsight, this was one of the best decisions I've made. Have a look at some of the [projects](/projects/) I've done.

Now, I'm halfway through my sixth and last year of university and so are looking for professional opportunities where I can gain practical experience in AI/ML/data science. 

Moreover, my career as an olympic weightlifter has already been much more succesful than that as a javelin thrower. In October this year, I participated in the Swedish nationals, my second competition ever, and I am proud to say that I secured a bronze medal in the clean and jerk.
