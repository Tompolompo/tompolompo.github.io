## Hello, this is me!
I'm an energetic, curious and social AI and ML enthusiast with a burning passion to make the world a better place for everyone in it. My background is in engineering physics, and I have been an elite athlete in both javeling throwing and olympic weightlifting. I'm looking for opportunities as a data scientist where I can foster my interest and improve my skills in AI and ML.
