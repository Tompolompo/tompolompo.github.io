## University Projects
Below are some selected data science projects I've done in my master. 
### Deep learning - *Fall 2021*
In this course we learned about various deep learning techniques and implemented some of them using **pytorch** . For the heavy computations we relied on **cloud computing** via Google Cloud. Some of the projects were:
- Image classifiers:
	- with simple **convolutional nets**
	- using **transfer learning** with the VGG16 architecture
- **Recurrent Neural Networks**: 
	- predict nationalities of names
- **Transformers**: 
	- sentiment analysis
- **Reinforcement Learning**: 
	- model free RL on grid worlds
	- Deep Q-learning on the CartPole environment
- **CycleGAN**:
	- **U-Net** and **PatchGAN** architectures 
	- style and morphological transfer of images in two domains

### Advanced simulation and machine learning
In this course we used many ML-methods rooted in Bayesian statistics. Some of the projects we did were
- Bayesian inference on generalized linear models
	- Using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling we fitted different cosmological models, including error modelling, on Type 1a supernovea data
- Comparison of advanced linear regression models
	- Estimated effective cluster interaction coefficients inferred by OLS, Ridge, covariance method, full Bayesian analysis (MCMC) and automatic relevance detection regression (ARDR)
- Global optimization
	- With Gaussian processes we efficiently found global minima of a multimodal surface using a LCB Aquisition function

### Advanced probabilistic machine learning



### Learning from data - *Fall 2020*
